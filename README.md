The overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. We reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

For each plot you should

All PNG files have a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
Name each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝3.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝4.𝚙𝚗𝚐.
A separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot is construct, i.e. code in 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁 constructs the 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐 plot.
